# Parameter Panther

“The holy grail for Revit” is what several people have called a web app like this. Why? Because project engineers can update Revit parameters with this web app from the comfort of their own browser. Revit (experience) is not required for the user of the app.

## What is it?
Parameter Panther - A tool to update Revit parameters from your browser, is a proof of concept web app built on top of Speckle during the [Speckle Hackathon 2022](https://speckle.systems/blog/hackathon-wrap-up/).

## How does it work?
You ask a BIM modeler to open the Revit model and send it to the Speckle server with one click. Then you can access the model and all the data with Parameter Panther and update the Revit instance parameters as per your requirements. When you are ready, the BIM modeler can receive the data which automatically updates the instance parameters in the Revit model.
